  <p>
    The Rector Police Department is proud to introduce you to our K-9 Officer 
    Elvis, a 17-month-old male German Shorthaired Pointer from Hungary, who has 
    quickly become an invaluable part of our team. Trained extensively in 
    narcotics detection and search and rescue operations, Elvis brings both 
    skill and heart to our department.
  </p>
  <p>
    Elvis is not just a working dogâ€”he's a dedicated partner to our officers 
    and a protector of our community. With his keen senses and specialized 
    training, he plays a critical role in helping locate missing persons, 
    detecting illegal substances, and assisting in high-risk operations. His 
    presence enhances both public safety and officer capability.
  </p>

  />
  <p>
    When he's not on duty, Elvis enjoys downtime with his handler and continues 
    to sharpen his skills through ongoing training. Friendly, focused, and 
    fearless, Elvis exemplifies the dedication and loyalty that define the K-9 
    unit.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are proud to have K-9 Elvis serve the citizens of Rector and look forward 
    to the many ways he will help keep our community.
