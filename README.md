# Rector City Website

This is the open-source codebase for the City of Rector, Arkansas website. It was built and is maintained by [Jeremy Jackson](https://github.com/jeremyvii) as a **volunteer civic project** with a focus on accessibility, simplicity, and long-term maintainability.

This website was built with the [U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), and is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator.
