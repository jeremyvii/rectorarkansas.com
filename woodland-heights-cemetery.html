        Located on the northwest edge of the city, Woodland Heights
        Cemetery stretches along a beautiful rolling countryside that makes
        up the beginnings of the Crowleyâ€™s Ridge foothills as they enter
        the city limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone in the community agrees that Woodland Heights is one of
        the most beautiful and best-maintained cemeteries in the region.
        The cemetery is owned by the city and operated by commission
        members. Woodland Heights Board members are: Steve Simmons,
        President; Cheri Boyd, Secretary/Treasurer; Nathan Henderson,
        Barbara Robertson, Hae Sue Weber members.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cemetery is operated on a sound financial basis, with all
        proceeds from the annual <a class="usa-link" href="/labor-day-picnic">Labor Day Picnic</a> going toward its maintenance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Approximately 6451 are buried in the cemetery, including some 814
        veterans. The Rector Veterans of Foreign Wars post conducts a
        Memorial Day service each year at Woodland Heights.
