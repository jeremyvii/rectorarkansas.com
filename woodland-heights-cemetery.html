            Located on the northwest edge of the city, Woodland Heights
            Cemetery stretches along a beautiful rolling countryside that makes
            up the beginnings of the Crowleyâ€™s Ridge foothills as they enter
            the city limits.

            Everyone in the community agrees that Woodland Heights is one of
            the most beautiful and best-maintained cemeteries in the region.
            The cemetery is owned by the city and operated by commission
            members. Woodland Heights Board members are: Steve Simmons,
            President; Cheri Boyd, Secretary/Treasurer; Nathan Henderson,
            Barbara Robertson, Hae Sue Weber members.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cemetery is operated on a sound financial basis, with all
            proceeds from the annual Labor Day Picnic going toward its maintenance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Approximately 6451 are buried in the cemetery, including some 814
            veterans. The Rector Veterans of Foreign Wars post conducts a
            Memorial Day service each year at Woodland Heights.
