      Numerous private aircraft owners use the facility, with special emphasis
      on companies that serve the agricultural community. The airport, which
      was constructed in 1966, has a runway of 3,960 feet.

      Over the years, Rector has maintained a strong working relationship with
      the Arkansas Dept. of Aeronautics and has received numerous grants for
      the development and maintenance of the airport. The city currently is
      working on such a grant for resurfacing the runway and making other
      improvements at the facility. In the future, the city will research the
      possibility of constructing additional hangars for private aircraft.
    </p>

      The airport is managed by the Municipal Airport Committee.
