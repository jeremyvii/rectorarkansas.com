          Numerous private aircraft owners use the facility, with special emphasis
          on companies that serve the agricultural community. The airport, which
          was constructed in 1966, has a runway of 3,960 feet.

          Over the years, Rector has maintained a strong working relationship with
          the Arkansas Dept. of Aeronautics and has received numerous grants for
          the development and maintenance of the airport. The city currently is
          working on such a grant for resurfacing the runway and making other
          improvements at the facility. In the future, the city will research the
          possibility of constructing additional hangars for private aircraft.
