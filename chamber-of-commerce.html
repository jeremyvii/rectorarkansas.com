      Rector is situated on a beautiful elevation of Crowley's Ridge, at the 
      western boundary of the St. Francis Valley, in Clay County, Arkansas. 
      Rector has been, and continues to be, at the heart of a thriving 
      agricultural area and the community also is home to an array of local 
      businesses and industry.
    </p>
    <p class="usa-paragraph">
      It is hoped that our endeavors will help to inspire other businesses to 
      relocate or expand into our fair city - and to endure. Our survival as a 
      community depends on cooperation with one another in a spirit of free 
      trade and community development.
