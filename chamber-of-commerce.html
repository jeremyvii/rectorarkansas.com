      Rector is situated on a beautiful elevation of Crowleyâ€™s Ridge, at the 
      western boundary of the St. Francis Valley, in Clay County, Arkansas. 
      Rector has been, and continues to be, at the heart of a thriving 
      agricultural area and the community also is home to an array of local 
      businesses and industry.

      It is hoped that our endeavors will help to inspire other businesses to 
      relocate or expand into our fair city - and to endure. Our survival as a 
      community depends on cooperation with one another in a spirit of free 
      trade and community development.
