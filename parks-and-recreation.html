      Adjoining Memorial Park on the south is Rector’s softball/baseball complex, 
      which includes four fields and a rodeo arena. These facilities serve both 
      local residents and visiting teams during tournaments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, Memorial Park has seen numerous improvements, including 
      landscaping, reforestation, and the planting of 64 new trees to replace 
      those lost to disease and high winds. Streets within the park have been 
      paved, and street lighting has been installed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The park features four flower beds maintained by the Rector Garden Club, 
      as well as two playgrounds with modern equipment that meets state and 
      federal safety standards. Underground wiring and coaxial cable connect to 
      all stands, allowing volunteers to bring their own TVs during events such 
      as the annual Labor Day Picnic.

      Three RV pads are available with full hookups: $17 per night for 30 amp 
      service and $27 for 50 amp, payable in advance. Reservations can be made

      Rector Memorial Park has hosted the annual Labor Day Picnic since 1941. 
      The park land was donated to the city around 1937 by former businessman 
      Alfred West.

      In the center of town is the Rector Downtown Central Park a beautifully 
      landscaped small park with a bandstand and a memorial walkway. Benches 
      and trees make it an inviting place to rest. The memorial brick walkway 
      is the primary source for financing the needs of the small park. In 
      1912, this little park was a rather unsightly, place for hitching 
      horses when people were visiting the train station. The Rector Woman’s 
      Club was formed in that year and made this muddy mess its first project. 
      Keeping with one of their goals the Rector Woman’s Club continued to 
      maintain and decorate the Park until the club disbanded. After that the 
      Rector Beautification Committee volunteered to oversee the upkeep of the 
      Downtown Central Park.
