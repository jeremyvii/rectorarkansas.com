        The Rector Volunteer Fire Department is a fully equipped service that
        provides fire protection and rescue services to the community of Rector
        and the surrounding area. The department's equipment, facilities and
        training, along with a close working relationship with the Rector Water
        Department, have enabled the community to post an excellent
        <span class="text-bold">Class 4 ISO Fire Protection</span> rating, the
        highest in the county. This rating not only means good response and
        results when a fire is reported, it also means lower insurance rates for
        local homeowners.
      </p>
      <p>
        The local department has a long history of proud service and dedication
        to the citizens of the community. It works closely with the water
        department to maintain adequate water storage and flow and increase the
        number of hydrants as necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        The department operates out of two local stations. The main station was
        constructed in 1997 and is located on Highway 49. As an added safety
        feature, a satellite station was constructed on the other side of the
        Union Pacific Railroad tracks on Dodd Street in 2006. The department is
        now working on a possible addition to the main station and purchasing a
        new state-of-the-art Thermal Imager.
      </p>
      <p>
        The city purchased a new pumper in 2006, which serves as the principal
        firefighting vehicle for the department. Also housed in the local
        stations are two 1995 pumpers. Other vehicles maintained by the
        department are a brush truck, rescue van and equipment van, and the
        department will take delivery of a new brush truck in April 2015 from the
        Arkansas Forestry Commission. The department features the latest in fire
        and rescue equipment, including a Jaws of Life apparatus obtained through
        a fund-raising effort sponsored by the Rector Woman's Club.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Rector Volunteer Fire Department has maintained late model equipment,
        and all firefighters attend classes throughout the year to learn the
        latest firefighting and rescue techniques.
