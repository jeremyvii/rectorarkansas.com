    <p>It's a joy to have you visit and learn more about the little town we call home!</p>
    <p>Rector is at the southern center of Clay County at the intersection of Highways 49 and 90. Resting on the edge of Crowley's Ridge, and surrounded by rich farmland it is a beautiful place to live. We have many outdoor opportunities, clubs, organizations, and churches. It is also home to our beloved Rector Cougars. We always have something to cheer about. </p>
    <p>Rector is a great place to work, play, raise a family, and do business. </p>
    <p>The town is made of buildings, streets, and businesses, but without our people, it is worth nothing at all. It is the people of Rector who give the town heart and truly make it a special place, a place to come home to. So many give of themselves and their time to enhance the greatness of this community. Our common values, love of small town life and dedication to others, make this a unique place to be, maybe the best place on earth. It's because of our family, friends, and neighbors right here in Rector. </p>
    <p>Again, thank you for your interest in our town. If I or our staff can assist you in any way, please call on us and we will do our best to serve you. </p>
    <p>God Bless you all!</p>
    <p>Mayor Shawn Brandon</p>
