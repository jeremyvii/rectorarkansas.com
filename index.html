    <p>It's a joy to have you visit and learn more about the little town we call home!</p>
    <p>Rector is at the southern center of Clay County at the intersection of Highways 49 and 90. Resting on the edge of Crowleyâ€™s Ridge, and surrounded by rich farmland it is a beautiful place to live. We have many outdoor opportunities, clubs, organizations, and churches. It is also home to our beloved Rector Cougars. We always have something to cheer about. </p>
