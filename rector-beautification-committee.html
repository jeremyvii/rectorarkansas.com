            The Rector Beautification Committee is responsible for several
            maintenance and improvements projects throughout the city, with special
            emphasis being the Rector Downtown Central Park. The committee envisioned
            the recent renovation and development of the park into a beautifully
            landscaped haven in the central business district accented by the
            Memorial Brick walkway. The park is the home for numerous activities
            throughout the year, including Spring Fest. The park also is decorated
            each year as part of the communityâ€™s Christmas lighting project.
          </p>

            The Memorial Brick Walkway in Rector Downtown Central Park is the
            principal fund-raising avenue for the committee. Persons who want to
            purchase a brick may contact City Hall.
