    <h2>About the Community Center</h2>
    <div class="usa-paragraph">
      <p>
        Rector residents are extremely proud of the city’s beautiful community
        center, located among the trees in Memorial Park on Highway 49.

        The facility, which opened in 1992, features a large multi-purpose room
        with stage, concert lighting, sound system and dressing rooms. It also
        offers a dining room with commercial kitchen, a meeting room and office
        area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to the opening of the new center, the community had no central
        location for hosting the many community events that are now frequent
        occurrences. Concerts, dinners, plays and reunions have become common
        and recurring events at the center. It is the home of the following
        annual events: “The Night of Chocolate” presented by the Clay County
        Arts Council, “The Ultimate Oldies” concert, the Chamber of Commerce
        Banquet, the Community Christmas Reception, the Community Chili
        Cook-off and the semi-annual Arts & Crafts Fair.

        The Community Center has also become the site for a number of community
        services. It becomes the City’s polling location on election days and
        hosts periodic blood drives. When the State was going to close the local
        Revenue Office, space was allotted in the Community Center and the
        Revenue office remains there today. It is a meeting place for several
        local organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the severe ice storm of 2009 the facility became a staging area
        and provided temporary shelter for residents without heat. Volunteers
        served more than a thousand free meals a day while the city was without
        power.
      </p>
      <p>
        The building was constructed through years of donations and fund
        raisers by community residents, a state grant and the special
        contribution of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Crockett. Donations of $1,000 or
        more are recognized in the center lobby, but all gifts were greatly
        appreciated in making the facility a reality. Donations still are
        needed for the maintenance and operation of the facility and persons
        wishing to contribute may contact the center at
        <a href="tel:+18705952188" class="usa-link">(870) 595-2188</a> or
        Rector City Hall at
        <a href="tel:+18705953035" class="usa-link">(870) 595-3035</a>.

        When the State was going to close the local Revenue Office, space was
        allotted in the Community Center and the Revenue office remains there
        today.
